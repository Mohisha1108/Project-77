     <p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard.
     It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input.
     While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console,
     the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.</p>
